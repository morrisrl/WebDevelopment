ANSWER TO "HOW DOES IT WORK?":

The way this program works is that once the user enters a task, it will be stored on the server side in the database hw03 and in the table
"things." If they click the check box, that task will be deleted from the table.  Once mySQL can select our database, it will run in our PHP file
we created and give the user an option to request to add a task. The user will also have the option to delete that task. These two options will only
work if we can connect to the database. If we cannot connect, then a message will display saying that if there isn't a table in the database, nothing
will be seen. If there is a table, it will show the records in the table that can be seen. If it can connect to the database but no database is available,
it will tell you exactly that. Else if it cannot connect, it will display a message saying it cannot connect whatsoever. 

At some point in our form in the PHP code (near the bottom), there could be multiple or 0 input tags based on what the user enters or deletes
as a task.

<?
  $result = mysql_connect('silo.soic.indiana.edu:45070', 'rachel', 'h0la42');
                          // host                port     username   password
  if ($result) {
    if (mysql_select_db("hw03")) { // database
      echo "I can select the database";

      if ($_REQUEST["add"]) { $query = "insert into things (task) values ('" . $_REQUEST["add"] . "')";
                              echo "<hr>" . $query . "<hr>"; // debug purposes
                            }
      if ($_REQUEST["delete"]) { $query = "delete from things where id = " . $_REQUEST["delete"];
                                 echo "<hr>" . $query . "<hr>"; // debug purposes
                               }
      $result = mysql_query($query);

      $query = "select * from things order by id asc"; // table of interest
      $result = mysql_query($query);
      if (! $result) echo "I don't see anything in here. <p>";
      else {
	$num_cats = mysql_num_rows($result);
        echo "There are " . $num_cats . " records I can see. <p>";
        while ($row = mysql_fetch_row($result)) {
          ?>
<form><input type=checkbox name=delete onClick=submit() value=<?=$row[0]?>> (<?=$row[0]?>, <?=$row[1]?>)</form><p>
        <?}
      }
    } else {
      echo "I can connect but I can't select the database. <p>";
    }
  } else {
    echo "I cannot connect. <p>";
  }
?>
<form>
Task: <input type=text name=add> <input type=submit value=Add>
</form>
